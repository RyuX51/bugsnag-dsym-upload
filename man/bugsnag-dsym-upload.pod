    bugsnag-dsym-upload - Uploads dSYMs to Bugsnag

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    bugsnag-dsym-upload [--verbose] [--api-key API_KEY]
                                    [--upload-server URL]
                                    [--symbol-maps MAP_DIR] dSYMS_PATH
    bugsnag-dsym-upload --help

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a directory, bugsnag-dsym-upload uploads any *.dSYM bundles with the
directory to the Bugsnag Upload API (https://upload.bugsnag.com). As a
pre-upload step, bitcode symbol maps can be combined with dSYM files to ensure
symbols are sent for bitcode-enabled binaries.

Given a ZIP archive containing .dSYM bundles, the archive is first inflated in a
temporary directory before uploading.
